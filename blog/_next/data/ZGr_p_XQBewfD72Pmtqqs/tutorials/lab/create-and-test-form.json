If you started the author instance with defaults as mentioned in the official docs, it should be `http://localhost:4502/` \n* After you are logged in, in the upper-left corner, tap **Adobe Experience Manager** > **Forms** > **Forms & Documents**. Tap Create and select Adaptive Form. \n** Select the `Blank with Core Components` template, \n** give a name to your form, for example, `Contact` and tap Create.\n\n\n* The form opens for editing and displays the contents available in the template. \n\n* Tap the Adaptive Forms Container component and Tap Properties. In the properties explorer, specify path of the Form Model Definition (`/content/dam/myheadlessform/af_model_sample.json`) uploaded as part of archetype project for the Forms Runtime Document Path option. The container component displays a rendition of the form\n\n* Please make sure that the form is rendered in content frame of forms editor on changing the `form runtime document path (form json)` from Adaptive Forms container component.\n\n> If form does not render on content frame, AEM Cloud service SDK was not started including the argument `-r prerelease`\n\n## Form rendering during local development\n\n- To render the form, hosted on your local development machine. Open the `[Archetype project]/ui.frontend.react.forms.af/.env` file and set the path of form. For example, `/content/forms/af/contact`. Open the command prompt and navigate to the `ui.frontend.react.forms.af` project and run the following command:\n```\nnpm run start\n```\n\n- The reason for adding form path to `.env` file is because the form json is [fetched from AEM](https://opensource.adobe.com/aem-forms-af-runtime/api/#tag/Get-Form-Definition). The `npm run start` command internally creates a proxy (ie) it routes all `/adobe` request to AEM server. You can also re-verify the same by opening the dev tools on your browser and checking the network tab.\n\n- Since the call is made to an AEM author instance to fetch the form model definition, please login to the AEM server on separate tab so that the fetch call is authenticated. This would not be required if an AEM publish instance is set-up. In case, the local AEM server is running on a url different than `http://localhost:4502`, the same needs to be updated [here](https://github.com/adobe/aem-forms-af-runtime/blob/gh-pages/lab1/ui.frontend.react.forms.af/webpack.dev.js#L24) for local development.\n\n- Once the above command is run, wait for the following message `webpack compiled with 4 warnings`. This means that the local development server has started successfully.","toc":[{"level":1,"text":"Create your first headless adaptive form","id":"create-your-first-headless-adaptive-form"},{"level":2,"text":"Create a Headless Adaptive Form inside AEM","id":"create-a-headless-adaptive-form-inside-aem"},{"level":2,"text":"Form rendering during local development","id":"form-rendering-during-local-development"}],"nextTitle":"Edit the Form","nextSlug":["lab","edit-form"],"prevTitle":"Step 3: Create your first project","prevSlug":["lab","archetype-project"],"subTitle":"Create your first Form","kind":"tutorials"}},"__N_SSG":true}
