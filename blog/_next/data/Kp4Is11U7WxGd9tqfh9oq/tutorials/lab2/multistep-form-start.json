{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Headless Adaptive Form : Creating a Multi Language Multistep Form","date":"2020-03-16T05:35:07.322Z","slug":["lab2","multistep-form-start"],"content":"\n# Download the Form to get started\n\nThe tutorial focuses on creating a wizard based experience for a Form using the JSON definition. This tutorial will start with a form and create a wizard based experience for the same. The steps would be similar for any other form as well.\n\nTo get started and follow the instructions in the upcoming steps download the form `loan-form.form.json` from the [git repo](https://github.com/adobe/aem-forms-af-runtime/blob/lab2/ui.frontend.react.forms.af/examples/multistep/loan-form.form.json)\n\n# Create the Form in AEM\n\nCreating the form in AEM is a two step process\n\n> The step may seem irrelevant after looking at the instructions that follow in this guide, but is required for the submission, workflows to execute in AEM\n\n## Upload the JSON Definition to your AEM Instance\n\nIf you have completed steps in lab1, you should be able to create a form in AEM with the JSON Definition downloaded earlier. If not, you can follow the steps mentioned below\n\n* Login to your AEM Instance\n* After you are logged in, in the upper-left corner, tap `Adobe Experience Manager > Assets > Files`. Tap Create and select Files. Upload the file `loan-form.form.json` as DAM asset in a folder of our choice\n\n\n## Create an Adaptive Form\n\n* After the upload is complete. Navigate to `Adobe Experience Manager > Forms > Forms & Documents`. You can see the contact form that was created in lab1.\n\n> If you have not performed the instructions in lab1, then you need to go back and follow the instructions to [Create a headless adaptive form in AEM](https://github.com/adobe/aem-forms-af-runtime/wiki/Lab-1---Beta#21-create-a-headless-adaptive-form-inside-aem)\n\n* Open the Form of your choice in the editor.\n\n* Once the editor loads completely, tap the Adaptive Forms Container component and Tap Properties. In the properties explorer, select the `loan-form.form.json` dam asset for the Forms Runtime Document Path option. The container component displays a rendition of the form which should look like the one shown below\n\n![Image](/assets/tutorial/lab2/loan-form-flat.png)\n\nYou can enable submit action on the form as well as done in the previous lab session\n## Download the JSON to work locally\n\nDownloading the JSON from AEM helps in working with it locally as it adds the necessary API calls to submit the Form to AEM and execute the configured submit action\n\n### List Forms\n\n* One can use the [list forms API](https://opensource.adobe.com/aem-forms-af-runtime/api/#tag/List-Forms) to get the forms available in the system.\n* After invoking the API, search for the Form Path and get the ID of the Form.\n\n### Fetch Form Model Definition\n* Use the [fetch form API](https://opensource.adobe.com/aem-forms-af-runtime/api/#tag/Get-Form-Definition) to get the form model definition\n* Right click, click on Save As, rename the extension to `.form.json` and save it inside `public` folder of `ui.frontend.react.forms.af` module. Please remove the additional fields `afModelDefinition`, `dataSchema` and `submissionTypes` from the json.\n* Preview the form in local development server using the following command,\n\n```shellSession\nnpm run start\n```\n\n> If your Form Path is different than the contact form created earlier then you may need to make some changes to the `.env` and `.env.development` files and update the correct FORM_PATH there, before invoking the command above\n\n> In the upcoming steps we will be making changes to the JSON saved in this step","toc":[{"level":1,"text":"Download the Form to get started","id":"download-the-form-to-get-started"},{"level":1,"text":"Create the Form in AEM","id":"create-the-form-in-aem"},{"level":2,"text":"Upload the JSON Definition to your AEM Instance","id":"upload-the-json-definition-to-your-aem-instance"},{"level":2,"text":"Create an Adaptive Form","id":"create-an-adaptive-form"},{"level":2,"text":"Download the JSON to work locally","id":"download-the-json-to-work-locally"},{"level":3,"text":"List Forms","id":"list-forms"},{"level":3,"text":"Fetch Form Model Definition","id":"fetch-form-model-definition"}],"nextTitle":"Enable Tabbed Layout for the Form","nextSlug":["lab2","add-step-form"],"prevTitle":"Setup Dev Environment","prevSlug":["lab2","dev-setup"],"subTitle":"Get Started with a simple Form","kind":"tutorials"}},"__N_SSG":true}
